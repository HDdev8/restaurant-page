# Restaurant Page

This is a simple restaurant page whose contents are generated by JavaScript.

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Webpack

Each page is generated by JavaScript in its own module, which is exported into index.js and then main.js along with style.css. When a tab is clicked, the page's current contents are cleared and replaced by the appropriate module. I use grid to create a responsive layout.

## Optimizations

I would add items to the menu page, add more to the contact page, and streamline my functions.

## Lessons Learned

I learned how to create, import, and export modules.
